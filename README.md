Here's a well-crafted `README.md` file for your **Full-Text Search Engine** project:

# Full-Text Search Engine
##NOTE: Read the documentation file for complete understanding.
## Overview
This Full-Text Search Engine is designed to efficiently index and search large sets of documents. It supports powerful features such as **inverted indexing**, **auto-suggestions**, and **text tokenization** with stemming and stop-word removal. By implementing multithreaded document processing, the system is optimized for speed and scalability.

### Key Features:
- **Inverted Indexing:** Enables fast lookup of documents containing specific terms.
- **Tokenization:** Converts documents into a list of searchable tokens.
- **Stop-Word Removal:** Filters out common words (like "the", "and") to enhance search relevance.
- **Multithreading Support:** Speeds up processing by concurrently handling multiple documents.

---
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C++17 or higher**: Make sure your environment supports C++17 for filesystem operations and threading.
- **Boost Library**: The project uses the Boost C++ library for string manipulation.

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```

### Building the Project

Make sure you have `.txt` files in the `Documents/` folder for indexing. The engine will read all text files and generate the inverted index.

---

## Usage

### Preprocessing Documents
The system tokenizes each document, removes stop words, and stems tokens to their root forms. This step is essential to create a more compact and efficient index.

```cpp
void preProcessTheData();
```

### Indexing
The inverted index structure allows for quick retrieval of documents containing specific terms.

```cpp
void buildInvertedIndex(const vector<string>& tokens, int docNumber);
```

### Searching
Once the documents are indexed, users can search for keywords. The system will retrieve and rank documents based on relevance.

---

## Future Enhancements
- **Phrase Searching**: Support for searching exact phrases instead of single keywords.
- **Synonym Support**: Adding synonyms to improve search results.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Dynamically update the index as documents are added or modified.
